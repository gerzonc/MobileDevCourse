# Homework II - Login Page (MVVM + Data Binding + INotifyPropertyChanged)

## Description 

- With the previous homework as base, we'll add a new sign up button. When we tap it, we must navigate to a sign up page, which must contain the following fields: Name, e-mail, password and confirm password.

- In the Login and Sign Up we must validate that the fields aren't empty like in the previous homework but this time from the ViewModel. Also, in the sign up we must validate that the password and the confirm password fields are the same. For this validation we must use an alert a label instead of an alert. 

- When we tap the Login button, app must navigate to a new screen called Home (HomePage). This page must contain a Master Detail or a Tabbed Page with the following options: Home | Option 1 | Option 2.
